Mic stuff doesn't quite work, dunno if that's my hardware issue or a code bug.

Libraries I'm using: `adafruit_ble/                adafruit_bluefruit_connect/  adafruit_pixelbuf.mpy        adafruit_pixel_framebuf.mpy  adafruit_pixelmap.mpy        neopixel.mpy                 neopixel_spi.mpy`

You probably don't need all those, but I just downloaded everything that looked relevant.
